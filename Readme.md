# Lox interpreter in Go

Hello, this is an idea i got where you read through the e-book from crafting-interpreters on making an interpreter and rewrite it in golang. The programming language is going to be called Lox.

The goal syntax of the project should be like the one seen here from the [crafting-interpreters The Lox Langugage](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).

Im just making this in Go because its the language i want to work with and i like go.

### Things I would like to change:

- Add explicit types (in the style of like C but keep the infering types sort of like in Go ':=' or a different symbol).
- Make it a compiled language.

### Future

Planning on taking the knowledge of this project and then rewriting it into my own programming language. My programming language must be compiled (because i said so) therefore i will have to change this code into a compiler.
