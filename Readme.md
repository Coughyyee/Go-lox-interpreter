# Lox interpreter in Go

Hello, this is a simple interpreter from the [crafting-interpreters The Lox Langugage](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) but rewritten in Go.

The goal syntax of the project should be like the one seen here from the [crafting-interpreters The Lox Langugage](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).

Im just making this in Go because its the language i like, thats really it. I hope you like it and that you can learn from it. This for me is also a learning experience but a fun and interesting one.

### Things I would like to change:

- Add explicit types (in the style of like C but keep the infering types sort of like in Go ':=' or a different symbol).
- Make it a compiled language.

### Future

Planning on taking the knowledge of this project and then rewriting it into my own programming language. My programming language must be compiled (because i said so) therefore i will have to change this code into a compiler.
